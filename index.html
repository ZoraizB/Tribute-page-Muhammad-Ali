      <h3>Who was Muhammad Ali?</h3>
      <p><b>Muhammad Ali</b> born <b>Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.</b>(on 17 January 1942 in Louisville, Kentucky, United States); was an American professional boxer and activist. Nicknamed "The Greatest", he is regarded as one of the most significant
        sports figures of the 20th century, and is frequently ranked as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time. In 1999, he was named Sportsman of the Century by <em>Sports Illustrated</em> and the Sports Personality of the Century by the
        <em>BBC</em>.

      <h3>A Boxing Prodigy</h3>
      <p>Born and Raised in louisville,Kentucky, he began training as an amateur boxer at the age of 12. Ali was first directed toward boxing by Louisville police officer and boxing coach Joe E. Martin, who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a
        thief's having taken his bicycle. He told the officer he was going to "whup" the thief. The officer told Clay he had better learn how to box first. Initially, Clay did not take up Martin's offer, but after seeing amateur boxers on a local
        television boxing program called <em>Tomorrow's Champions</em>, Clay was interested in the prospect of fighting. He turned professional after winning a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics just by the age
        of 18. Just after
        emerging as the world champion, Cassius Clay Jr. publicly declared his conversion and made a personal declaration of independence: “I believe in Allah and in peace,” he said. “I don’t try to move into white neighborhoods. I don’t want to
        marry a white woman. I was baptized when I was 12, but I didn’t know what I was doing. I’m not a Christian anymore. I know where I’m going and I know the truth and I don’t have to be what you want me to be. I’m free to be what I want.” He
        renounced his birth name as a "slave name" and formally changed his name to <b>Muhammad Ali.</b> </p>

      <h3>Spectacles Outside the Ring</h3>
      <p> In 1966, Ali refused to be drafted into the military owing to his religious beliefs and ethical opposition to the Vietnam War and was found guilty of draft evasion and stripped of his boxing titles. He stayed out of prison while appealing
        the decision to the Supreme Court, where his conviction was overturned in 1971.<br> However, he had not fought for nearly four years by this point and had lost a period of peak performance as an athlete.Ali's actions as a conscientious
        objector
        to the Vietnam War made him an icon for the larger 1960s counterculture generation, and he was a very high-profile figure of racial pride for African Americans during the civil rights movement and throughout his career.Outside boxing, Ali
        attained success as a spoken word artist, releasing two studio albums: I Am the Greatest! (1963) and The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay (1976). Both albums received Grammy Award nominations. He also featured as an actor
        and writer, releasing two autobiographies. Ali retired from boxing in 1981 and focused on religion, philanthropy and activism. In 1984, he made public his diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome, which some reports attributed to boxing-related
        injuries, though he and his specialist physicians disputed this. He remained an active public figure globally, but in his later years made fewer public appearances as his condition worsened, and he was cared for by his family. </p>

      <p>Ali was hospitalized in Scottsdale, Arizona, on June 2, 2016, with a respiratory illness. Though his condition was initially described as fair, it worsened, and he died the following day at the age of 74 from septic shock.Ali's funeral had
        been pre-planned by himself and others for several years prior to his actual death. The services began in Louisville on June 9, 2016, with an Islamic Janazah prayer service at Freedom Hall on the grounds of the Kentucky Exposition Center. On
        June 10, 2016, the funeral procession passed through the streets of Louisville ending at Cave Hill Cemetery, where his body was interred during a private ceremony. A public memorial service for Ali at downtown Louisville's KFC Yum! Center was
        held during the afternoon of June 10. Billy Crystal gave the eulogy. The pallbearers included Will Smith, Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson, with honorary pallbearers including George Chuvalo, Larry Holmes and George Foreman. Ali's memorial was
        watched by an estimated 1 billion viewers worldwide.<br>

        "If the measure of greatness is to gladden the heart of every human being on the face of the earth, then he truly was the greatest. In every way he was the bravest, the kindest and the most excellent of men."
